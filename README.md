name of the project (alphanumeric, no spaces, max 32 chars; this will also be your URL)


the proposed project
Homeless communities around the United States
We propose a website that is a tool for both people wanting to help homeless people around them and also a tool
for homeless people to see what is available for them. 

URLs of at least three data sources that you will programmatically scrape using a RESTful API (be very sure about this)

at least three models
Regions - places in the US where the homeless community is large and what the population is, why they are more populated there etc.
Shelters - where homeless shelters are in those regions (and where you can volunteer)
Soup Kitchens/Food Banks - where you can donate food or time making food for homeless people

an estimate of the number of instances of each model

each model must have many attributes

describe five of those attributes for each model that you can filter or sort

instances of each model must connect to instances of at least two other models

instances of each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc.) (be very sure about this)

describe two types of media for instances of each model

describe three questions that your site will answer
